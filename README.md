# EchoSense - An Arduino Based Project

Our project draws inspiration from sonar devices commonly employed in submarines and boats. It focuses on detecting objects or potential obstacles within a 180-degree range directly in front of it.


## Working Principle
The Ultrasonic Sensor emits sound waves, which upon hitting obstacles, return to be received by its sensor. It measures the distance between the device and the obstacle, displaying detected objects and their angles on the screen. Mounted on a servo motor, it scans a 180-degree span, all managed by an Arduino board.
